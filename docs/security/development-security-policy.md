## Personal Accountant Application

### Document Control
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Effective Date**: July 5, 2025
- **Review Date**: January 5, 2026
- **Owner**: Lead Developer
- **Classification**: Internal Use

## 1. Code Development and Release Process

### 1.1 Development Workflow
**Current Development Process**:
1. **Local Development**: Code changes made on local development environment
2. **Version Control**: All changes committed to GitHub repository with descriptive commit messages
3. **Branch Management**: Feature branches for significant changes, main branch for stable code
4. **Code Review**: Self-review of code changes before committing to main branch
5. **Testing**: Local testing of functionality before deployment
6. **Documentation**: Update of relevant documentation with code changes

### 1.2 GitHub Repository Security
**Repository Configuration**:
- Private repository access only
- Strong authentication required for access
- Branch protection rules on main branch
- Commit signing enabled where possible
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning via Dependabot

### 1.3 Release Management
**Current Release Process**:
1. **Code Completion**: Feature development completed and locally tested
2. **Version Tagging**: Git tags for version releases
3. **Release Notes**: Documentation of changes and features
4. **Deployment**: Manual deployment to production environment (when available)
5. **Post-Deployment Verification**: Functional testing after deployment

## 2. Code Testing and Quality Assurance

### 2.1 Testing Requirements
**Mandatory Testing Before Production**:
- **Unit Testing**: Individual component functionality verification
- **Integration Testing**: API integration testing, especially Plaid connectivity
- **Security Testing**: Input validation, authentication, and authorization testing
- **Performance Testing**: Application performance under expected load
- **User Acceptance Testing**: End-to-end functionality verification

### 2.2 Automated Testing Implementation
**Current Testing Setup**:
- Jest testing framework for React components
- API testing for Plaid integration endpoints
- Code linting with ESLint for code quality
- TypeScript compilation for type safety
- Manual testing of critical user flows

### 2.3 Testing Documentation
- Test cases documented for critical functionality
- Test results recorded before any production deployment
- Regression testing for bug fixes and new features
- Performance benchmarks maintained

## 3. Code Review and Approval Process

### 3.1 Review Requirements
**Development Phase Review Process**:
- **Self-Review**: Developer reviews own code before committing
- **Peer Review**: Code review by another team member when available
- **Security Review**: Security-focused review of authentication, data handling, and API integrations
- **Documentation Review**: Ensure adequate documentation of changes

### 3.2 Approval Workflow
**Current Approval Process**:
1. **Technical Review**: Code functionality and security assessment
2. **Business Logic Review**: Verify features meet requirements
3. **Security Assessment**: Review for security vulnerabilities
4. **Documentation Update**: Ensure policies and procedures are current
5. **Deployment Approval**: Final approval for production deployment

## 4. Data Encryption Standards

### 4.1 Data in Transit Encryption
**TLS Implementation**:
- **Development**: HTTPS enforced for all external communications
- **Production**: TLS 1.3 mandatory for all client-server communications
- **API Communications**: All Plaid API calls over HTTPS/TLS 1.3
- **Internal Communications**: Encrypted connections between application components

### 4.2 Data at Rest Encryption
**Plaid API Data Protection**:
- **Database Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for all stored financial data
- **File System Encryption**: Full disk encryption on development machines
- **API Response Storage**: Encrypted storage of any cached Plaid API responses
- **Key Management**: Secure storage and rotation of encryption keys

### 4.3 Implementation Details
**Current Encryption Status**:
- Development environment uses HTTPS for external connections
- Local storage encrypted via operating system full-disk encryption
- Planned: Database encryption for production deployment
- Planned: Key management service for production environment

## 5. Audit Trail and Logging

### 5.1 Application Logging
**Required Logging Events**:
- User authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Plaid API interactions (requests/responses metadata)
- Database transactions involving financial data
- Administrative actions and configuration changes
- Security-related events and errors

### 5.2 Log Management
**Current Logging Implementation**:
- Application logs using structured logging format
- Console logging for development environment
- File-based logging with rotation
- Log retention for development phase: 30 days minimum
- Planned: Centralized logging system for production

### 5.3 Audit Requirements
**Audit Trail Components**:
- Timestamp of all actions
- User identification for all transactions
- Source IP address and location data
- Action performed and outcome
- Data accessed or modified

## 6. Security Monitoring and Alerting

### 6.1 Development Phase Monitoring
**Current Monitoring Capabilities**:
- GitHub security alerts for dependency vulnerabilities
- Application error monitoring and logging
- Manual monitoring of application performance
- Regular review of access logs and patterns

### 6.2 Production Monitoring (Planned)
**Real-time Security Monitoring**:
- Automated intrusion detection systems
- Anomaly detection for user behavior
- API rate limiting and abuse detection
- Real-time alerting for security events
- 24/7 monitoring of critical systems

### 6.3 Alert Configuration
**Alert Categories**:
- **Critical**: Security breaches, data access violations
- **High**: Failed authentication attempts, system errors
- **Medium**: Performance degradation, unusual patterns
- **Low**: Information events, maintenance notifications
