# Hosting Strategy - Personal Accountant Application

## Current Hosting Environment

### Development Phase
**Current Setup**: Local development environment on personal laptops
- **Host**: Personal laptop machines (development/testing phase)
- **Environment**: Personal computing environment with password protection
- **Access**: Localhost only during development
- **Authentication**: Password-based with facial recognition backup on primary laptop
- **Backup**: Code repository maintained on GitHub

### Production Hosting Strategy

#### Planned Infrastructure
**Cloud Provider**: To be determined (AWS/Azure/GCP recommended)
- **Justification**: Enterprise-grade security, compliance certifications, scalability
- **Key Requirements**: SOC 2 compliance, encryption at rest/transit, DDoS protection

#### Architecture Components

1. **Frontend Hosting**
   - **Platform**: Static hosting service (Vercel/Netlify/CloudFront)
   - **Security**: CDN with edge security, HTTPS enforcement
   - **Access**: Public web access with authentication

2. **Backend API Hosting**
   - **Platform**: Container orchestration (Kubernetes/ECS) or serverless (Lambda/Functions)
   - **Security**: Private subnets, VPC isolation, API Gateway with rate limiting
   - **Access**: HTTPS only, authenticated API calls

3. **Database Hosting**
   - **Platform**: Managed database service (RDS/CosmosDB/Cloud SQL)
   - **Security**: Encryption at rest, private network access, automated backups
   - **Access**: Application-only access through secure connection strings

#### Security Controls

1. **Network Security**
   - VPC/Virtual Network isolation
   - Security groups/Network Security Groups with minimal required access
   - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - DDoS protection

2. **Access Control**
   - Identity and Access Management (IAM) with least privilege
   - Multi-factor authentication for administrative access
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Regular access reviews

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
   - Encryption at rest (AES-256)
   - Secure key management service
   - Database encryption

4. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Centralized logging (CloudWatch/Azure Monitor/Stackdriver)
   - Security incident and event management (SIEM)
   - Real-time monitoring and alerting
   - Audit trails for all access and changes

#### Compliance & Certifications

**Target Compliance Standards**:
- SOC 2 Type II
- PCI DSS (if handling payment data)
- GDPR compliance (data protection)
- Regional financial data protection regulations

**Cloud Provider Certifications Required**:
- ISO 27001
- SOC 1/2/3
- FedRAMP (if applicable)
- PCI DSS Level 1

#### Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Automated daily backups
   - Cross-region backup replication
   - Point-in-time recovery capabilities
   - Regular backup restoration testing

2. **High Availability**
   - Multi-availability zone deployment
   - Auto-scaling capabilities
   - Load balancing with health checks
   - Circuit breaker patterns for external services

3. **Incident Response**
   - 24/7 monitoring and alerting
   - Incident response playbooks
   - Communication plans for security incidents
   - Regular disaster recovery drills

#### Security Assessment & Testing

**Regular Security Practices**:
- Quarterly vulnerability assessments
- Annual penetration testing
- Continuous security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Third-party security audits

**Code Security**:
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
- Secure code review processes

#### Migration Timeline

**Phase 1**: Development (Current)
- Local hosting for development and testing
- Security controls implementation
- Documentation and policy creation

**Phase 2**: Staging Environment
- Cloud staging environment setup
- Security testing and validation
- Performance and load testing

**Phase 3**: Production Deployment
- Production environment deployment
- Security certifications and audits
- Go-live with full monitoring

#### Cost Considerations

**Security vs. Cost Balance**:
- Utilize cloud provider security services to reduce custom implementation costs
- Implement security controls that scale with usage
- Consider managed services to reduce operational overhead
- Regular cost optimization reviews

#### Third-Party Integrations

**Plaid Integration Security**:
- Secure API key management
- Network isolation for Plaid API calls
- Audit logging of all Plaid interactions
- Compliance with Plaid security requirements

**Security Vendors**:
- Consider security-focused vendors for critical components
- Evaluate third-party security tools and services
- Ensure all vendors meet security and compliance requirements
